					<h3>Vaccinate Karnataka</h3>
						<p>This Campaign was launched by the Krs Party to pressurise the Government to increase the vaccination pace in the State. As part of the campaign, All Elected Representatives of the Congress Party pledged 1 Crore Rupees from their MP/MLA LAD Funds which raised 100 Crores to start an independent Vaccination Drive by tying-up with Pvt Hospitals to provide vaccination to the people of the state for free.

						KRS President Krishna Reddy & along with all the Office Bearers of KRS led this campaign in a spirited manner which sent shivers across the  Leadership that eventually had to reject the proposal of Krs Party to save its face.

						Then, the campaign was modified to initiate awareness among the people by involving the kids through a unique programme. As part of the campaign, hundreds of children and students in the state shared videos on Vaccine Awareness on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram through #VaccinateKarnataka hashtag.</p>

						<h3>Sonkita Sarkara</h3>
							<p>Karnataka BJP government, which was supposed to take care of the people of the state, indulged in corruption even during a global pandemic. This inhuman government also made money on people's dead bodies by amassing money in buying beds, Remidesivir, ventilators, gloves, PPE kits and sanitiser.

							Moreover, the negligence, irresponsibility and corruption of this 'infected government' which was involved in internal conflict, portfolio fighting, CD flirting & transfer racket soured the lives of the people of the state.

							Against this, KRS Party Leaders and MLAs took part in the Legislative House wearing masks with the inscription 'Sonkita Sarkara - meaning Infected Government' and conveyed the anger of the people of the state to the government & ensured that the government held its head in shame.</p>
